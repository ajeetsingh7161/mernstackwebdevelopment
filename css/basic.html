    <h2><u>Early life</u></h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family.
      His mother Saroj Kohli is a homemaker while his father Prem Nath Kohli
      worked as a criminal lawyer. He has an elder brother Vikas and an elder
      sister Bhawna. His formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar. His early
      education was at Vishal Bharti Public School.[4] As per his family, Kohli
      exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a 3-year-old. He would pick up
      a bat and request his father bowl to him.[5] In 1998, the West Delhi
      Cricket Academy was created. In May, his father arranged for him to meet
      Rajkumar Sharma.[6] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's
      father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as
      they believed his ability merited more than gully cricket.[7] Kohli was
      unable to secure a place in the U-14 Delhi team, due to extraneous
      factors. His father reportedly received offers to relocate his son to
      influential clubs, which would ensure his selection, but he declined the
      proposals. Kohli eventually found his way into the U-15 team.[8] He
      received training at the academy and participated in matches at the Sumeet
      Dogra Academy located at Vasundhara Enclave.[9] To further his cricket
      career, he transferred to Saviour Convent School during his ninth
      grade.[7] On 18 December 2006, his father died due to a cerebral
      attack.[10] As per his mother, Kohli's demeanour shifted noticeably after
      his father's death. He took on cricket with newfound seriousness,
      prioritizing playing time and dedicating himself fully to the sport.[7]
      Kohli's family resided in Meera Bagh, Paschim Vihar until 2015, after
      which they relocated to Gurgaon.[11]

    <h2><u>Youth career</u></h2>
    <p>
      Kohli's junior cricket career kicked off in October 2002 at the Luhnu
      Cricket Ground against Himachal Pradesh. His first half-century in
      domestic cricket happened at Feroze Shah Kotla, where he scored 70 runs
      against Haryana.[12] By the end of the season, he had amassed a total of
      172 runs, emerging as the highest run-scorer for his side with an average
      of 34.40.[13] During the 2003–04 season of Polly Umrigar Trophy, Kohli was
      appointed the captain of the U-15 team.[13] He scored 54 runs in Delhi's
      victory over Himachal Pradesh. In the next fixture against Jammu and
      Kashmir, Kohli scored his maiden century with a score of 119. By the end
      of the season, he had a total of 390 runs at an average of 78, which
      included two centuries.[14] Towards the end of 2004, Kohli earned
      selection for the 2004–05 Vijay Merchant Trophy with the Delhi U-17
      team.[13] In the four matches that he played, Kohli had a total of 470
      runs, with his highest score being 251* runs. The team's coach, Ajit
      Chaudhary, lauded his performance and was particularly impressed with his
      temperament on the field.[15] He commenced the 2005–06 season with a score
      of 227 against Punjab. Following their victory over Uttar Pradesh in the
      quarter-finals, Delhi was scheduled to play against Baroda in the
      semi-finals. The team had high expectations from Kohli, who had promised
      his coach to finish the job. True to his word, Kohli went on to score 228
      runs, leading Delhi to victory. The team later secured the tournament with
      a five-wicket win over Mumbai, where he contributed with a half-century in
      the first innings.[16] He ended as the highest run-scorer with a total of
      757 runs from 7 matches, averaging 84.11.[17]
